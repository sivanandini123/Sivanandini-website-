SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC).</u></h1></b><br>
<p> The software development process is a series of steps or phases that are followed to develop a software product. It 
is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. The process 
typically includes activities such as planning, requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and 
maintenance.<br>

   The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the stages involved in the software development process. It provides a structured approach to managing the development of software applications. 
The SDLC typically includes the following phases: <br>
<h1>1. Planning:</h1> This phase involves defining the scope of the project, identifying the requirements, and creating a project plan.<br>
<h1>2.Analysis: </h1>This phase involves analyzing the requirements and creating a design for the software.<br>
<h1>3.Design:</h1> This phase involves creating a detailed design for the software, including the user interface, database design, and system architecture.<br>
<h1>4.Coding: </h1>This phase involves writing the code for the software.<br>
<h1>5. Testing:</h1> This phase involves testing the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and is free of defects.<br>
<h1>6. Deployment: </h1>This phase involves deploying the software to the users.<br>
<h1>7. Maintenance: </h1>This phase involves maintaining the software after it has been deployed, including fixing bugs and adding new features. <br>
There are many different SDLC models, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common SDLC models include the waterfall model, the agile model, and the spiral model.</p>
